It would be interesting to see, for example, if Civilization 6’s player activity dropped noticeably after the release of Civilization 7, in February of 2025."

The 3 steamcharts.com I scraped from were very simple, and I didn’t have to do much more than the standard beautifulsoup process to pull out the tables. After I had pulled out the tables, I removed the first row and separated the “Month” column into new “Month” and “Year” columns. Once I had added a column to identify each observation with the game it was associated with, concatenating the dataframes together was a breeze."

Players: The average player count at any given time during the month Gain: The increase/decrease in average players, vs the previous month % Gain: The % increase/decrease in average players, vs the previous month Peak Players: The single highest recorded concurrent player count during the observed month Game: The name of the game observed (Civilization 6, Europa Universalis, Humankind) In total, there are 311 unique observations in the dataset.\n\nSummary statistics\nAll-time Peak player count  All-time Average player count \nAs I expected, Civilization 6 (my favorite) had the highest peak player count. One interesting thing to note is that despite Humankind having a higher all-time player peak than Europa Universalis, its all-time average player count was hardly a tenth of Europa’s! This is likely due to the huge hype that was built around Humankind before its release, it being touted as a “Civ-Killer” meant to outclass the games in the Civilization franchise. As the summary statistics and internet commentary point out, the release was a huge letdown for many people who bought into the hype surrounding Humankind. This makes sense, as the month in which Humankind hit their top player count was the first month of its release, which in the next two months dropped by nearly 90%"
